Simple React Voting App 
=======================
Check demo [here](http://youssef06.github.io/react-vote/index.html)

I built this simple Voting app for learning purposes, if you have any suggestion/fix please feel free to contribute :).

Setup
-----

to setup the app on your machine:

- Install all dependencies by running
```
npm install
```

- Build the app and watch file changes with 
```
gulp
```


> **With Firebase:** You can find the same App powered by a Firebase database [here](https://github.com/youssef06/react-vote-firebase).
